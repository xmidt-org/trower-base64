This started as a fork of the implementation Bob Trower produced and released in
2001.  You can find the original here: http://base64.sourceforge.net/

## Why fork?

As we started using the library we found it was hugely handy, but had a few bugs
and not as many tests as we wanted.  As the upstream project seems to have lost
steam, we decided to fork, improve, release and ship.
